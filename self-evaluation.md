# Self Evaluation

- How might the `each` method be useful?
        It would be helpful for repetitive code or code patterns.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?
        I think I need to practice and learn more about how to use some of these functions. I kept forgetting double quotations for puts.
- What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this assignment?
        Looking at other classmate's entries helped me realize my very vital mistake of forgetting the "" around #{}.
        I kind of had a hard time looking up things and digesting the information and using critical thinking to wittle the information
        down for someone who is just learning.
